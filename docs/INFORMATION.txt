I developed Extracker to be more than just a logging tool; it's a comprehensive driving analytics engine. I architected the system using a custom MVC framework to maintain complete control over the request lifecycle, routing requests through a central dispatcher to separated controllers. A key technical achievement was implementing a robust 'Live Tracking' feature using the Geolocation API, where I engineered algorithms to filter GPS noise and calculate accurate distances using the Haversine formula on the client side before synchronizing with the server. I tackled complex data integrity challenges by enforcing strict validation rules—ensuring logical time sequences and mandatory environmental data—and standardizing all temporal data to UTC to support global usage seamlessly. On the database side, I designed a normalized schema with junction tables to handle many-to-many relationships for road types and traffic conditions, optimizing query performance for the dashboard's analytics. To ensure reliability in production, I implemented a centralized error handling mechanism and secured the deployment pipeline with GitHub Actions, automating the release process while keeping sensitive credentials protected. This project showcases my ability to build secure, scalable, and user-centric full-stack applications from scratch.
